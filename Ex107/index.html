         <br>Write a JavaScript program to find the number of sorted pairs formed by arrays of integers. This is such that one element in the pair is divisible by the other one.

        <br>For example - The output of [1, 3, 2] ->2 - (1,3), (1,2).
        <br>The output of [2, 4, 6] -> 2 - (2,4), (2,6)
        <br>The output of [2, 4, 16] -> 3 - (2,4), (2,16), (4,16)
